# Growth Kit

Complete non-development toolkit for taking ideas from concept to market. Five modular sub-skills that work together or independently.

**Think of it as:** A fractional CMO + Product Strategist in a box. Figures out what you need before diving into tactics.

---

## When to Use This Orchestrator

**Use this orchestrator when:**

- User doesn't know where to start
- User has a vague goal ("I need marketing", "help me launch")
- User isn't sure which sub-skill applies
- User needs a multi-step workflow
- User wants to audit what's missing

**Skip to sub-skill directly when:**

- User has a specific task ("write a landing page", "generate an image")
- User knows exactly which skill they need
- User is continuing work from a previous skill

```

---

## The Context Paradox (Critical)

**More input doesn't always mean better output.**

This is counterintuitive but essential: sometimes running a skill with LESS context produces better results than running it with everything from previous skills.

### Why This Happens

**1. Information Overload**
When Claude has too much context, it tries to incorporate everything. Output becomes:

- Hedged and committee-sounding
- Overly comprehensive (loses punch)
- Trying to please all inputs (pleases none)

**2. Conflicting Signals**
Different skills optimize for different things:

- Research is broad and inclusive
- Direct response copy needs narrow focus and conviction
- Feeding broad research into narrow copy = diluted output

**3. Loss of Boldness**
Great copy has conviction. Too much research creates:

- "On one hand... on the other hand..."
- Qualifiers and hedges
- Safe, forgettable messaging

### The Rule: Selective Context Passing

```
FULL CONTEXT (pass everything)
├── voice-profiler → ALL other skills (voice should be consistent)
├── hook-finder → direct-response-copy (need the angle)
└── keyword-research → seo-content (need the targets)

LIGHT CONTEXT (pass summary only)
├── hook-finder → lead-magnet-builder (angle + pain points only)
├── keyword-research → direct-response-copy (main keyword only)
├── competitive-intel → marketing (key gaps only)
└── target-segments → marketing (primary segment only)

FRESH START (don't pass, run clean)
├── When previous output feels off
├── When you want a different angle
├── When output is getting worse, not better
└── When you need bold, not comprehensive
```

### The Compression Principle

When passing between skills, compress:

| From                | Pass This                     | Not This                  |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| idea-extraction     | Core strategy (1 page)        | Full interview transcript |
| competitive-intel   | Key differentiators (bullets) | All competitor details    |
| voice-profiler      | Voice summary (3 sentences)   | Full profile              |
| hook-finder         | Winning angle (1-2 sentences) | All options               |
| keyword-research    | Priority cluster + 5 keywords | Full spreadsheet          |
| lead-magnet-builder | Hook + format                 | Full concept doc          |
| seo-content         | Key insights (bullets)        | Full article              |

### Signs of Over-Contexting

Output is suffering from too much context when:

- Sentences have multiple qualifiers
- Copy tries to address multiple audiences
- Headlines are long and compound
- CTAs have multiple value propositions
- Reads like a committee wrote it
- Lost the "one person talking to one person" feel

**Fix:** Strip context back to essentials, run again.

### When to Run Fresh

Run execution skills **without** full context when:

- Output from chained skills feels generic or hedged
- You want bold, opinionated copy
- Previous skill output was mediocre
- You're testing a different angle
- Copy needs to feel human, not researched-to-death

**Fresh start prompt:**

> "Write [asset type] for [offer]. Target: [one sentence]. Angle: [one sentence]. Ignore everything else. Be bold."

## Handoff Protocol

When routing to a sub-skill, provide:

### Context Block Format

```markdown
## Orchestrator Handoff

**Goal:** [User's stated goal]
**Current state:** [What exists]
**This skill's job:** [Specific outcome needed]

**Inputs available:**

- Voice profile: [yes/no, summary if yes]
- Positioning: [yes/no, angle if yes]
- Keywords: [yes/no, priority cluster if yes]
- Research: [yes/no, key insight if yes]

**After this skill:** [What comes next in sequence]
```

### Example Handoff to marketing/direct-response-copy

```markdown
## Orchestrator Handoff

**Goal:** Convert visitors to trial signups for SaaS product
**Current state:** Has voice profile, has positioning ("speed over features" angle)
**This skill's job:** Write landing page copy that converts

**Inputs available:**

- Voice profile: Yes (direct, no-fluff, developer-friendly)
- Positioning: Yes ("Ship in days, not months")
- Keywords: No (not SEO-focused landing page)
- Research: Yes (competitors focus on feature lists)

**After this skill:** Route to media-creation/social-graphics for launch visuals
```

---

## The Orchestrator Conversation

### Opening

"Before we dive into tactics, let me understand your situation.

**What phase are you in?**

1. New idea to validate
2. Need to understand my market
3. Ready to create marketing content
4. Need visual assets
5. Launching something
6. Not sure / need help figuring it out"

### Follow-Up Based on Answer

**If unclear:** "What do you already have in place? (validated idea, research, voice, positioning, content, landing pages)"

**If phase is clear:** "Do you have [prerequisite for that phase] defined? If not, we should start there."

### Recommendation Format

"Based on what you've told me, here's what I recommend:

**Immediate:** [Skill/file] - [Why this first]

**Then:** [Skill/file] - [What this builds on]

**After that:** [Skill/file] - [End result]

Want to start with [first skill]? I'll need [inputs required]."

## Anti-Patterns

### Don't:

- Jump to tactics without diagnosis
- Run execution skills without foundation (voice, positioning)
- Skip idea validation for "obvious" ideas
- Try to do everything at once
- Assume one skill solves everything
- **Feed everything from every skill into the next** (context overload)
- **Chain skills when output is getting worse** (stop and simplify)

### Do:

- Start with qualifying questions
- Build foundation before execution
- Sequence skills logically
- Track what's been created
- Recommend next steps after each skill
- **Compress context between skills** (essentials only)
- **Run fresh when output feels off** (sometimes less is more)

---

## The Quality Gate

Before passing output to next skill, ask:

1. **Is this output actually good?** If mediocre, don't pass it - garbage in, garbage out
2. **Does the next skill need ALL of this?** Usually no - extract the essence
3. **Will more context help or hurt?** For strategy: help. For execution: often hurt
4. **Would a human strategist share all this?** A good CMO filters, doesn't dump

---

## The Test

Good orchestration means:

1. **User knows where to start** (not overwhelmed)
2. **Skills run in logical order** (dependencies respected)
3. **Outputs feed into next skill** (no wasted work)
4. **Progress is trackable** (what's done, what's next)
5. **End result is coherent** (pieces work together)

If user still feels lost after orchestration, the diagnosis failed.
