   - Introduction: TARGET × 0.20 to 0.25
   - Main Body: TARGET × 0.55 to 0.65
   - Conclusion: TARGET × 0.15 to 0.20
5. If description missing, infer from title + keyword

## Making Your Choice

Claude Code and Cursor each excel in distinct areas of AI-assisted development. Your choice ultimately depends on whether you prioritize deep reasoning capabilities or rapid code generation for routine tasks.

### Beyond the Feature Comparison

The real difference isn't just in what these tools can doâ€"it's in how they fit your development workflow. Claude Code's terminal integration shines when you're architecting complex systems or working across multiple files. Cursor's instant completions excel when you're in flow state writing implementation code.

Looking ahead, both tools will continue evolving, but the fundamental trade-offs remain: depth versus speed, reasoning versus reflex. The developers who succeed won't be those who pick the "best" tool, but those who understand when to use each one strategically. The question isn't which AI assistant you chooseâ€"it's how effectively you leverage its strengths for your specific challenges.
```

**Tier-Based Expansion Guidelines:**

**If Under Target Range:**

- Expand thin sections with more detail
- Add specific examples or case studies
- Develop subsections more fully
- Include additional context where valuable
- **Do NOT add fluff or repetition**

**If Within Target Range:**

- Light polish only
- Fix any awkward phrasing

- No filler content
- Strong throughout

---

### STAGE 9.5: Humanization Quality Check

**Purpose:** Ensure content reads as human-written, not AI-generated. This is the critical differentiator between content that ranks and content that gets penalized.

**Humanization Techniques Applied:**

1. **Sentence Length Variation:**

   - Check for AI pattern: Medium. Medium. Medium. (consistent length)
   - Apply human pattern: Short. Then something longer. Short again. A fragment. Back to medium.
   - Target mix: 20% short (<10 words), 60% medium (10-25 words), 20% long (25+ words)

2. **Contractions Check:**

   - AI tendency: "Do not," "cannot," "will not"
   - Human reality: "Don't," "can't," "won't"
   - Apply contractions naturally throughout

3. **Personal Voice Injection:**

   - Add where appropriate: "I've found that...", "In my experience...", "Here's what most people miss..."
   - Include opinions defended with reasoning, not hedged statements

4. **Conversational Asides:**

   - Add parentheticals where natural: "(And yes, this applies to you too.)"
   - Include tangents that add value: "Side note: this also works for..."

5. **Specifics Over Generics:**

   - Replace: "Many users" with "47 users"
   - Replace: "Significant improvement" with "23% improvement"
   - Replace: "Various tools" with "Notion, Airtable, and Linear"

6. **Varied Sentence Openings:**

   - Avoid repetitive subject-verb-object patterns
   - Start with: "Because...", "Although...", "After...", questions

7. **Rhythm Breaks:**
   - Short paragraphs for emphasis
   - Single-sentence paragraphs for impact
   - Varied section lengths

**AI Detection Red Flags - MUST REMOVE:**

**Overused Adjectives (eliminate or replace):**

- Comprehensive -> thorough, complete, in-depth
- Robust -> reliable, solid, dependable
- Seamless -> smooth, effortless, integrated
- Innovative -> new, fresh, different
- Cutting-edge -> latest, modern, current
- Streamlined -> simplified, efficient, lean
- Game-changing -> significant, major, important

**Filler Transitions (eliminate entirely):**

- Furthermore -> (just connect ideas directly)
- Moreover -> (just say it)
- Additionally -> also, plus, and
- In conclusion -> (don't announce, just conclude)
- Consequently -> so, as a result
- Subsequently -> then, next, after

**Empty Intensifiers (remove):**

- Significantly
- Dramatically
- Tremendously
- Incredibly

**Cliche Openings (rewrite completely):**

- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "As we all know..."
- "It's no secret that..."
- "In the ever-evolving landscape of..."

**Structural Tells to Fix:**

- Every section same length -> vary deliberately
- Every paragraph same structure -> mix patterns
- Perfectly balanced lists -> make one item longer
- Same transitions throughout -> diversify
- Conclusions that just summarize -> add new perspective

**E-E-A-T Quality Check:**

- [ ] **Experience:** Specific personal examples, real stories, actual numbers from work
- [ ] **Expertise:** Depth of reasoning, nuanced takes, not surface-level
- [ ] **Authoritativeness:** Clear point of view, defended positions
- [ ] **Trust:** Admits limitations, acknowledges counterarguments, cites sources

**Final Humanization Validation:**

Read the article aloud. Ask:

1. Does it sound like a person talking to another person?
2. Could you identify the author's personality without a byline?
3. Are there opinions and preferences, not just facts?
4. Do the examples feel real, not hypothetical?
5. Is there anything that sounds like a committee wrote it?

If any answer is "no," revise that section.

- Use **Standard (1200-1600)** if topic needs comprehensive coverage

**For Authority Builders:**

- Use **Standard (1200-1600)** for typical authority content
- Use **Comprehensive (2200-2800)** for deep-dive comparisons
- Use **Authority (3000-3500+)** only for pillar/hub articles

**For Intent Signals:**

- Default to **Compact (500-700)** for question-based content
- Questions typically answered concisely

**For Hub/Spoke Architecture:**
