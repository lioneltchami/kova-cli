## Pricing Fundamentals

### The Three Pricing Axes

Every pricing decision involves three dimensions:

**1. Packaging** - What's included at each tier?
- Features, limits, support level
- How tiers differ from each other

**2. Pricing Metric** - What do you charge for?
- Per user, per usage, flat fee
- How price scales with value

**3. Price Point** - How much do you charge?
- The actual dollar amounts
- Perceived value vs. cost

### Value-Based Pricing Framework

Price should be based on value delivered, not cost to serve:

```
Customer's perceived value of your solution     $1000
    |
    v  (Value captured - your opportunity)
    |
Your price                                      $500
    |
    v  (Consumer surplus - value customer keeps)
    |
Next best alternative                           $300
    |
    v  (Differentiation value)
    |
Your cost to serve                              $50
```

**Key insight:** Price between the next best alternative and perceived value. Cost is a floor, not a basis.

## Pricing Research Methods

### Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter

Identifies the acceptable price range for your product.

**The Four Questions:**

1. "At what price would you consider [product] to be so expensive that you would not consider buying it?" (Too expensive)
2. "At what price would you consider [product] to be priced so low that you would question its quality?" (Too cheap)
3. "At what price would you consider [product] to be starting to get expensive, but you still might consider it?" (Expensive/high side)
4. "At what price would you consider [product] to be a bargain - a great buy for the money?" (Cheap/good value)

**How to Analyze:**

1. Plot cumulative distributions for each question
2. Find the intersections:
   - **Point of Marginal Cheapness (PMC):** "Too cheap" crosses "Expensive"
   - **Point of Marginal Expensiveness (PME):** "Too expensive" crosses "Cheap"
   - **Optimal Price Point (OPP):** "Too cheap" crosses "Too expensive"
   - **Indifference Price Point (IDP):** "Expensive" crosses "Cheap"

**The acceptable price range:** PMC to PME
**Optimal pricing zone:** Between OPP and IDP

**Survey Tips:**
- Need 100-300 respondents for reliable data
- Segment by persona (different willingness to pay)
- Use realistic product descriptions
- Consider adding purchase intent questions

**Sample Output:**
```
Price Sensitivity Analysis Results:
-----------------------------------
Point of Marginal Cheapness:  $29/mo
Optimal Price Point:          $49/mo
Indifference Price Point:     $59/mo
Point of Marginal Expensiveness: $79/mo

Recommended range: $49-59/mo
Current price: $39/mo (below optimal)
Opportunity: 25-50% price increase without significant demand impact
```

### MaxDiff Analysis (Best-Worst Scaling)

Identifies which features customers value most, informing packaging decisions.

**How It Works:**
1. List 8-15 features you could include
2. Show respondents sets of 4-5 features at a time
3. Ask: "Which is MOST important? Which is LEAST important?"
4. Repeat across multiple sets
5. Statistical analysis produces importance scores

**Using MaxDiff for Packaging:**

| Utility Score | Packaging Decision |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Top 20% | Include in all tiers (table stakes) |
| 20-50% | Use to differentiate tiers |
| 50-80% | Higher tiers only |
| Bottom 20% | Consider cutting or premium add-on |

### Other Research Methods

**Gabor-Granger method:**
"Would you buy [product] at [$X]?" (Yes/No)
Vary price across respondents to build demand curve.

**Conjoint analysis:**
Show product bundles at different prices. Respondents choose preferred option. Statistical analysis reveals price sensitivity per feature.

## Value Metrics

### What is a Value Metric?

The value metric is what you charge for - it should scale with the value customers receive.

**Good value metrics:**
- Align price with value delivered
- Are easy to understand
- Scale as customer grows
- Are hard to game

### Common Value Metrics

| Metric | Best For | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Per user/seat | Collaboration tools | Slack, Notion |
| Per usage | Variable consumption | AWS, Twilio |
| Per feature | Modular products | HubSpot add-ons |
| Per contact/record | CRM, email tools | Mailchimp, HubSpot |
| Per transaction | Payments, marketplaces | Stripe, Shopify |
| Flat fee | Simple products | Basecamp |
| Revenue share | High-value outcomes | Affiliate platforms |

### Choosing Your Value Metric

**Step 1: Identify how customers get value**
- What outcome do they care about?
- What do they measure success by?
- What would they pay more for?

**Step 2: Map usage to value**

| Usage Pattern | Value Delivered | Potential Metric |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| More team members use it | More collaboration value | Per user |
| More data processed | More insights | Per record/event |
| More revenue generated | Direct ROI | Revenue share |
| More projects managed | More organization | Per project |

**Step 3: Test for alignment**
Ask: "As a customer uses more of [metric], do they get more value?"
- If yes > good value metric
- If no > price doesn't align with value

## Tier Structure

### How Many Tiers?

**2 tiers:** Simple, clear choice
- Works for: Clear SMB vs. Enterprise split
- Risk: May leave money on table

**3 tiers:** Industry standard
- Good tier = Entry point
- Better tier = Recommended (anchor to best)
- Best tier = High-value customers

**4+ tiers:** More granularity
- Works for: Wide range of customer sizes
- Risk: Decision paralysis, complexity

### Good-Better-Best Framework

**Good tier (Entry):**
- Purpose: Remove barriers to entry
- Includes: Core features, limited usage
- Price: Low, accessible
- Target: Small teams, try before you buy

**Better tier (Recommended):**
- Purpose: Where most customers land
- Includes: Full features, reasonable limits
- Price: Your "anchor" price
- Target: Growing teams, serious users

**Best tier (Premium):**
- Purpose: Capture high-value customers
- Includes: Everything, advanced features, higher limits
- Price: Premium (often 2-3x "Better")
- Target: Larger teams, power users, enterprises

### Tier Differentiation Strategies

**Feature gating:**
- Basic features in all tiers
- Advanced features in higher tiers
- Works when features have clear value differences

**Usage limits:**
- Same features, different limits
- More users, storage, API calls at higher tiers
- Works when value scales with usage

**Support level:**
- Email support > Priority support > Dedicated success
- Works for products with implementation complexity

**Access and customization:**
- API access, SSO, custom branding
- Works for enterprise differentiation

### Example Tier Structure

```
                 | Starter      | Pro          | Business
                 | $29/mo       | $79/mo       | $199/mo
-----------------+--------------+--------------+--------------
Users            | Up to 5      | Up to 20     | Unlimited
Projects         | 10           | Unlimited    | Unlimited
Storage          | 5 GB         | 50 GB        | 500 GB
Integrations     | 3            | 10           | Unlimited
Analytics        | Basic        | Advanced     | Custom
Support          | Email        | Priority     | Dedicated
API Access       | X            | Yes          | Yes
SSO              | X            | X            | Yes
Audit logs       | X            | X            | Yes
```

## Freemium vs. Free Trial

### When to Use Freemium

**Freemium works when:**
- Product has viral/network effects
- Free users provide value (content, data, referrals)
- Large market where % conversion drives volume
- Low marginal cost to serve free users
- Clear feature/usage limits for upgrade trigger

**Freemium risks:**
- Free users may never convert
- Devalues product perception
- Support costs for non-paying users
- Harder to raise prices later

### When to Use Free Trial

**Free trial works when:**
- Product needs time to demonstrate value
- Onboarding/setup investment required
- B2B with buying committees
- Higher price points
- Product is "sticky" once configured

**Trial best practices:**
- 7-14 days for simple products
- 14-30 days for complex products
- Full access (not feature-limited)
- Clear countdown and reminders
- Credit card optional vs. required trade-off

**Credit card upfront:**
- Higher trial-to-paid conversion (40-50% vs. 15-25%)
- Lower trial volume
- Better qualified leads

### Hybrid Approaches

**Freemium + Trial:**
- Free tier with limited features
- Trial of premium features
- Example: Zoom (free 40-min, trial of Pro)

**Reverse trial:**
- Start with full access
- After trial, downgrade to free tier
- See premium value, live with limitations until ready

## When to Raise Prices

### Signs It's Time

**Market signals:**
- Competitors have raised prices
- You're significantly cheaper than alternatives
- Prospects don't flinch at price
- "It's so cheap!" feedback

**Business signals:**
- Very high conversion rates (>40%)
- Very low churn (<3% monthly)
- Customers using more than they pay for
- Unit economics are strong

**Product signals:**
- You've added significant value since last pricing
- Product is more mature/stable
- New features justify higher price

### Price Increase Strategies

**1. Grandfather existing customers**
- New price for new customers only
- Existing customers keep old price
- Pro: No churn risk
- Con: Leaves money on table, creates complexity

**2. Delayed increase for existing**
- Announce increase 3-6 months out
- Give time to lock in old price (annual)
- Pro: Fair, drives annual conversions
- Con: Some churn, requires communication

**3. Increase tied to value**
- Raise price but add features
- "New Pro tier with X, Y, Z"
- Pro: Justified increase
- Con: Requires actual new value

**4. Plan restructure**
- Change plans entirely
- Existing customers mapped to nearest fit
- Pro: Clean slate
- Con: Disruptive, requires careful mapping

### Communicating Price Increases

**For new customers:**
- Just update pricing page
- No announcement needed
- Monitor conversion rate

**For existing customers:**
```
Subject: Updates to [Product] pricing

Hi [Name],

I'm writing to let you know about upcoming changes to [Product] pricing.

[Context: what you've added, why change is happening]

Starting [date], our pricing will change from [old] to [new].

As a valued customer, [what this means for them].

[If affected:] You have until [date] to [action].
[If grandfathered:] You'll continue at your current rate.

We appreciate your continued support of [Product].

[Your name]
```

## Pricing Psychology

### Apply These Principles

- **Anchoring:** Show higher-priced option first
- **Decoy effect:** Middle tier should be obviously best value
- **Charm pricing:** $49 vs. $50 (for value-focused)
- **Round pricing:** $50 vs. $49 (for premium)
- **Annual savings:** Show monthly price but offer annual discount (17-20%)

See `marketing/references/marketing-psychology.md` for the complete psychology framework.
