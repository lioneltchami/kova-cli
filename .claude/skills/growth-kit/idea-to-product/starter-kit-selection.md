- **Coverage Percentage:** X%

### Estimated Gap Work

- [Gap 1]: ~X hours
- [Gap 2]: ~X hours
- [Gap 3]: ~X hours
- **Total Gap Work:** ~X hours
```

### Step 3: Compare and Select

```markdown

| Tech stack fit   | Good/Fair/Poor | -       | -       |
| Documentation    | Good/Fair/Poor | -       | -       |
| Community        | Active/Limited | -       | -       |
| Price            | $X             | $X      | $X      |
| Gap work (hours) | X              | X       | X       |

### Selection Decision

**Selected Kit:** [Name]

**Reasoning:**

1. [Reason 1]
2. [Reason 2]
3. [Reason 3]

**Key Trade-offs Accepted:**

1. [Trade-off 1]

## Gap Analysis

After selecting a starter kit, document what needs to be built:

```markdown
## Development Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps (MVP Blockers)

| Gap     | Description      | Estimated Effort | Priority |
| ------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | -------- |
| [Gap 1] | [What's missing] | X hours          | P0       |
| [Gap 2] | [What's missing] | X hours          | P0       |

### Important Gaps (Launch Blockers)

| Gap     | Description      | Estimated Effort | Priority |
| ------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | -------- |
| [Gap 1] | [What's missing] | X hours          | P1       |

### Nice-to-Have Gaps (Post-Launch)

| Gap     | Description      | Estimated Effort | Priority |
| ------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | -------- |
| [Gap 1] | [What's missing] | X hours          | P2       |

### Total Effort Estimate

- **MVP (P0):** X hours
- **Launch (P0+P1):** X hours
- **Full Feature (All):** X hours
```
