# Idea to Product Discovery

A complete product discovery and validation skill pack for Claude Code. Take any business idea from concept through competitive analysis, technical planning, and implementation-ready specifications.

---

## What This Is

A structured workflow for validating and planning new products:

- **Idea Extraction** - Deep-dive interviews to surface viable concepts
- **Competitive Intel** - Understand the market landscape
- **Starter Kit Selection** - Match requirements to technical foundations
- **Transformation Analysis** - Plan implementation across 7 domains
- **Expert Co-founder** - Create an AI advisor with full context

**Think of it as:** A product discovery consultant in your Claude Code. Validates before you build, plans before you code.

**Related Skills:**

- `research` - For detailed competitor analysis, segments, and keywords
- `marketing` - For content creation and go-to-market execution
- `media-creation` - For visual assets, brand direction, and image generation
- `crawl-cli` - For web crawling and content extraction

## Integration with Marketing Skill

The idea-to-product and marketing skills are designed to work together:

### Handoff Points

| From idea-to-product    | To marketing        | What transfers                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| idea-extraction         | hook-finder         | Core value prop, target customer |
| competitive-intel       | competitor-analysis | Competitive landscape, gaps      |
| idea-extraction         | voice-profiler      | Brand personality, tone          |
| transformation-analysis | gtm-playbook        | Timeline, launch readiness       |

### Recommended Sequence

**For new products:**

1. Complete idea-to-product workflow (all 5 phases)
2. Start marketing with hook-finder (uses strategy from phase 1)
3. Run competitor-analysis (extends competitive-intel from phase 2)
4. Continue with marketing execution skills

**For existing products:**

- Skip to marketing skill directly
- Use idea-extraction only if pivoting or repositioning

## Quick Reference

### By Situation

| Situation         | Start With              | Then                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| Brand new idea    | idea-extraction         | Full workflow         |
| Know the market   | competitive-intel       | Continue from phase 2 |
| Have requirements | starter-kit-selection   | Continue from phase 3 |
| Kit selected      | transformation-analysis | Continue from phase 4 |
| Ready to build    | expert-cofounder        | Then marketing skill  |

## Context Passing

### What Flows Forward

```
idea-extraction
├── → competitive-intel: Target market, key differentiators
├── → starter-kit-selection: Technical requirements, constraints
└── → expert-cofounder: Full strategy document

competitive-intel
├── → starter-kit-selection: Integration requirements
├── → transformation-analysis: Feature comparison needs
└── → expert-cofounder: All competitor briefs

starter-kit-selection
├── → transformation-analysis: Selected kit, gap analysis
└── → expert-cofounder: Technical decisions

transformation-analysis
└── → expert-cofounder: Implementation plan, task lists
```

### Compression Principle

When passing between phases, compress:

| From                    | Pass This              | Not This                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| idea-extraction         | Core strategy (1 page) | Full interview transcript |
| competitive-intel       | Key differentiators    | All competitor details    |
| starter-kit-selection   | Selected kit + gaps    | Evaluation matrix         |
| transformation-analysis | Priority tasks         | Full domain analysis      |

---

## Anti-Patterns

### Don't:

- Skip idea extraction for "obvious" ideas (validate anyway)
- Rush through competitive intel (your positioning depends on it)
- Choose a kit without requirements (leads to rework)
- Start coding before transformation analysis (hidden complexity)
- Forget to create expert co-founder (loses all context)

### Do:

- Spend adequate time on idea extraction
- Document all competitor insights
- Match kit capabilities to actual requirements
- Create atomic, testable tasks
- Maintain expert co-founder as source of truth

---

3. **If ready for content:** Start with `research/keyword-research.md` then SEO content
4. **If launching soon:** Start with `marketing/05-gtm/gtm-playbook.md`

### Context to Pass

When invoking marketing skills, provide:

```markdown
## Product Context (from idea-to-product)

**Product:** [One-line description]
**Target Customer:** [Who it's for]
**Core Problem Solved:** [The pain point]
