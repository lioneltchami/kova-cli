# AI Image Generation

Core execution skill for AI image generation. Handles model selection, prompt construction, API calls, iteration, and quality verification.

**Use this skill when:** You need to generate any image and want optimal quality.
**Route here from:** skill-overview.md (visual strategist) or direct requests.

---

## Why This Skill Exists

**The problem:** Most people waste time and money on AI image generation because they:

1. Use the wrong model for the job
2. Write vague prompts that produce generic results
3. Generate once and hope for the best
4. Don't know how to iterate effectively

**The solution:** A systematic approach that:

- Uses the right model for the task
- Constructs prompts with proven structure
- Builds in iteration as the default workflow
- Knows when to stop and when to keep refining

---

## Model Selection

### Primary: Nano Banana Pro via Glif (DEFAULT)

**Why:** Fastest high-quality generation available. ~20 seconds vs ~3 minutes for comparable quality.

| Model                            | Glif ID                     | Speed  | Quality   |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------ | --------- |
| **Nano Banana Pro Text 2 Image** | `cmi7ne4p40000kz04yup2nxgh` | ~20sec | Excellent |

**Use the `run_glif` MCP tool:**

```
Glif: Nano Banana Pro Text 2 Image
ID: cmi7ne4p40000kz04yup2nxgh
Inputs: ["Your prompt here"]
```

### When to Use Alternatives

```
IF user specifically requests a different model:
    use requested model

ELIF need text rendering (logos, quotes, announcements):
    use Recraft v3 or Ideogram v3

ELIF need image-to-video:
    generate image first, then use video model

ELSE:
    Nano Banana Pro via Glif  // DEFAULT
```

## Prompt Construction

### The Formula

```
[SUBJECT] + [SETTING/CONTEXT] + [STYLE] + [LIGHTING] + [QUALITY BOOSTERS]
```

Each element serves a purpose:

- **SUBJECT** - What you're generating (be specific)
- **SETTING** - Where/context (grounds the image)
- **STYLE** - Visual aesthetic (photography, illustration, etc.)
- **LIGHTING** - Mood and dimension (often overlooked, always important)
- **QUALITY BOOSTERS** - Technical terms that elevate output

---

### Subject Specificity

**Bad:** "A coffee cup"
**Good:** "Artisan ceramic coffee cup with latte art, steam rising"

**Bad:** "A laptop"
**Good:** "Silver MacBook Pro on oak desk, screen showing code editor"

**Bad:** "A person working"
**Good:** "Woman in her 30s, focused expression, typing on laptop in bright modern office"

The more specific your subject, the less the model has to guess.

---

### Setting/Context Options

**Studio/Clean:**

```
on pure white background
against dark charcoal gradient
floating in negative space
on seamless backdrop
```

**Environmental:**

```
in modern minimalist office
on rustic wooden table

```

**Abstract:**

```

```

---

### Style Presets

**Photography Styles:**

```

portrait photography
macro photography
aerial/drone photography
```

**Illustration Styles:**

```

---

### Lighting Presets

Lighting is the most underused prompt element. It dramatically affects mood and quality.

side lighting from right
overhead soft box
underlighting (dramatic)
```

---

### Quality Boosters

Add these to elevate output quality:

**Technical Quality:**

```
ultra-detailed
high resolution
sharp focus
professional quality
8k resolution
```

**Professional Context:**

```
commercial photography
award-winning

## Aspect Ratio Guide

| Use Case                          | Ratio | Pixels    | Notes                |
| --------------------------------- | ----- | --------- | -------------------- |
| Square (Instagram, LinkedIn)      | 1:1   | 1024x1024 | Most versatile       |
| Landscape (Hero banners, YouTube) | 16:9  | 1280x720  | Web standard         |
| Portrait tall (Instagram feed)    | 4:5   | 1024x1280 | Better feed presence |
| Stories/TikTok                    | 9:16  | 1080x1920 | Vertical mobile      |
| Pinterest                         | 2:3   | 1000x1500 | Optimal for pins     |
| Wide cinematic                    | 21:9  | 2560x1080 | Dramatic headers     |

**Default:** 1:1 unless platform-specific requirement is known.

## Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Clarify Requirements

Before generating, know:

```
- What is the subject? (be specific)
- What style/aesthetic?
- What platform/use case?
- What aspect ratio?
- Any must-have elements?
- Any must-avoid elements?
```

### Step 2: Construct Prompt

Use the formula:

```
[SUBJECT] + [SETTING] + [STYLE] + [LIGHTING] + [QUALITY BOOSTERS]
```

### Step 3: Generate First Draft

```
Glif: Nano Banana Pro Text 2 Image
ID: cmi7ne4p40000kz04yup2nxgh
Inputs: ["[constructed prompt]"]
```

### Step 4: Present for Feedback

```markdown
## Image Generated

**Prompt:** [prompt used]
**Aspect Ratio:** [ratio]

**Image URL:** [URL]

**Quick Assessment:**

- Subject accuracy: Y/N
- Style match: Y/N
- Composition: Y/N
- Quality: Y/N

**Feedback?**

- What works?
- What should change?
- Ready to approve or iterate?
```

### Step 5: Iterate Based on Feedback

Common iteration patterns:

```
"Too dark" - Add "bright" "well-lit" "high key lighting"
"Too busy" - Add "minimal" "clean" "simple composition"
"Wrong style" - Be more explicit about style reference
"Missing element" - Add specific element to prompt
"Wrong mood" - Adjust lighting and color descriptors
```

### Step 6: Approve or Continue

- If approved: Deliver final image
- If needs changes: Return to Step 5
- If fundamentally wrong: Return to Step 2 with new prompt approach

## Iteration Strategies

### When It's Close But Not Right

**Problem:** Almost right but something's off
**Strategy:** Make targeted prompt adjustments

```
Original: "Coffee cup on table"
Iteration 1: "Coffee cup on table, warmer tones" (if too cool)
Iteration 2: "Coffee cup on table, warmer tones, more steam" (if missing element)
```

### When It's Completely Wrong

**Problem:** Output doesn't match intent at all
**Strategy:** Rewrite prompt from scratch with more specificity

Don't iterate on a bad foundation. Start fresh with better prompt construction.

### When Quality Is Low

**Problem:** Image looks AI-generated or low quality
**Strategy:** Add quality boosters and professional context

```
Add: "ultra-detailed, professional photography, commercial quality"
Add: "8k resolution, sharp focus, magazine quality"
```

### When Composition Is Wrong

**Problem:** Elements in wrong places, bad framing
**Strategy:** Be explicit about composition

```
Add: "subject centered in frame"
Add: "negative space on left for text"
Add: "rule of thirds composition"
Add: "close-up shot" or "wide establishing shot"
```

## Tips from Experience

### What Works

1. **Specificity beats creativity** - "Red 2024 Tesla Model 3" beats "cool car"
2. **Lighting is underrated** - Always specify lighting direction/type
3. **Negative space matters** - Mention if you need room for text
4. **Iterate fast** - Don't overthink first prompt, generate and refine
5. **Quality boosters work** - "Professional photography, ultra-detailed" actually helps

### What Doesn't Work

1. **Vague prompts** - "Something cool" produces nothing useful
2. **Too many elements** - Keep focused, don't cram everything in
3. **Ignoring aspect ratio** - Always match to intended platform
4. **Single generation** - Plan for iteration, don't expect perfection first try
5. **Wrong model for text** - Standard image models struggle with text rendering

### The 80/20

80% of good results come from:

1. Specific subject description
2. Clear style direction
3. Explicit lighting
4. Appropriate aspect ratio

Get these four right, and you'll get good results.
