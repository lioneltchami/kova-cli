## Context Passing Between Skills

### The Rule: Selective Context

Not all information should flow between skills. Too much context produces generic, hedged output.

```
FULL CONTEXT (pass everything)
├── voice-profiler → ALL other skills (voice should be consistent)
├── hook-finder → direct-response-copy (need the angle)
└── (research) keyword-research → seo-content-* (need the targets)

LIGHT CONTEXT (pass summary only)
├── hook-finder → lead-magnet-builder (angle + pain points only)
├── (research) keyword-research → direct-response-copy (main keyword only)
└── lead-magnet-builder → newsletter (concept only)

FRESH START (don't pass, run clean)
├── When previous output feels off
├── When you want a different angle
├── When output is getting worse
└── When you need bold, not comprehensive
```

### Compression Principle

When passing between skills, compress:

| From                | Pass This                     | Not This         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------- |
| voice-profiler      | Voice summary (3 sentences)   | Full profile     |
| hook-finder         | Winning angle (1-2 sentences) | All options      |
| (research) keywords | Priority cluster + 5 keywords | Full spreadsheet |
| lead-magnet-builder | Hook + format                 | Full concept doc |
| seo-content-writing | Key insights (bullets)        | Full article     |

## State Tracking

After each skill runs, record:

```markdown
## Marketing Assets Status

### Foundation

- [ ] Brand voice profile: [exists/missing]
- [ ] Positioning/differentiation: [exists/missing]

### Research (from research skill)

- [ ] Competitor analysis: [exists/missing]
- [ ] Target segments: [exists/missing]
- [ ] Keyword clusters: [exists/missing]

### Execution

- [ ] Lead magnet concept: [exists/missing]
- [ ] Landing page(s): [exists/missing]
- [ ] Content pieces: [count]
- [ ] Newsletter setup: [exists/missing]
- [ ] Email sequences: [exists/missing]

### Distribution

- [ ] Social content: [exists/missing]
- [ ] Reddit presence: [exists/missing]

### What to Build Next

Based on gaps: [recommendation]
```

---

## Handoff Protocol

When routing to a skill, provide:

```markdown
## Skill Handoff

**Goal:** [User's stated goal]
**Current state:** [What exists]
**This skill's job:** [Specific outcome needed]

**Inputs available:**

- Brand voice: [yes/no, summary if yes]
- Positioning: [yes/no, angle if yes]
- Keywords: [yes/no, priority cluster if yes]

**After this skill:** [What comes next in sequence]
```

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Don't:

- Jump to tactics without diagnosis
- Run execution skills without foundation (voice, positioning)
- Skip the research skill when you need data
- Try to do everything at once
- Assume one skill solves everything
- Feed everything from every skill into the next (context overload)
- Chain skills when output is getting worse (stop and simplify)

### Do:

- Start with qualifying questions
- Build foundation before execution
- Use research skill for data needs
- Sequence skills logically
- Track what's been created
- Recommend next steps after each skill
- Compress context between skills (essentials only)
- Run fresh when output feels off (sometimes less is more)

---

## The Test

Good orchestration means:

1. **User knows where to start** (not overwhelmed)
2. **Skills run in logical order** (dependencies respected)
3. **Outputs feed into next skill** (no wasted work)
4. **Progress is trackable** (what's done, what's next)
5. **End result is coherent** (pieces work together)

If you still feel lost after using this skill pack, start with the diagnostic questions at the top of this file.
